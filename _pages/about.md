I am an associate at Cornerstone Research focusing on antitrust casework. I received a PhD in economics from UCLA where my research focused on topics in empirical industrial organization.

At Cornerstone Research I analyze complex antitrust and competition matters. I have experience with mergers in a variety of industries including supporting the Alaska Airlines/Hawaiian Airlines merger through the regulatory review process.

In my PhD research, I try to provide answers to questions that help sellers and platforms make better product selection and pricing decisions. My primary research focus is on how firms introduce and price new products under uncertainty.
